gutters, alignment options, and optionally responsive properties, it is powerful

Grid is a simpler version of [Flex](/components/flex), with the ability to set
the number of columns used when calculating item widths. If you need more
flexibility for your layout, or you do not need to align to a columnar layout,
use Flex instead.`
